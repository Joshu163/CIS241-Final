	<H3>Videography & Photography</h3>
		<p>My passion for photography and videography unexpectedly occured during my high school years. At first,
		I enrolled in a photography class simply to fulfill credit requirements.
		Little did I know that this decision would lead to a profound love for
		capturing moments through the lens. As I dove into the intricacies of composition, lighting, and storytelling,
		I discovered a newfound appreciation for the art form. The classroom transformed into a space where my
		creativity flourished, and soon, I found myself not only meeting academic obligations but also cultivating
		a genuine passion for the captivating world of visual storytelling. This serendipitous journey ignited
		a lifelong love affair with photography and videography that continues to shape my artistic expression
		and perspective on the world.</p>

	<h3>Video Games</h3>
		<p>My journey into the world of video games commenced at the age of 7, sparking a lifelong fascination. 
		Over the years, my dedication to gaming has led me to explore all types of gaming consoles and sytems,
		providing me with diverse gaming experiences. From the early days of console gaming
		to my current preference for the PC, I have witnessed the evolution of the industry. Among the
		multitude of games I've encountered, three stand out as perennial favorites:
		the dynamic and open-world adventure of Grand Theft Auto V, the fast-paced and competitive realm of Fortnite,
		and the captivating universe of Destiny. These games not only serve as a testament to my gaming journey but
		also continue to be a source of joy and excitement in my ongoing exploration of virtual worlds.

	<h3>Fitness</h3>
		<p>My fitness journey began at the age of 15 when my passion for soccer drove me to seek ways to enhance
		my performance in the sport. Eager to elevate my skills, I decided to incorporate weight lifting into my routine.
		What began as a means to improve my athletic abilities soon transformed into a full-fledged obsession.
		The tangible results and the empowering feeling of strength and resilience became addictive,
		prompting me to make weight lifting my primary and enduring fitness pursuit. From that initial desire
		to excel in soccer, I found a lifelong commitment to the transformative power of weight lifting,
		shaping not only my physique but also my dedication to a healthy and active lifestyle.</p>
