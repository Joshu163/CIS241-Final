		<h1>Reflections</h1>
			<p> Throughout this quarter, I have gained a profound understanding
			of the complexities of CSS and its essential role in shaping the
			visual elements of a website.</p>
			
			<p>One of the "Ah ha!" moments that stands out is the realization of
			the power and flexibility that CSS's power and flexibility in styling web pages.
			The course not only equipped me with the technical skills to manipulate
			layouts and design, but it also fostered a creative mindset,
			enabling me to turn a blank canvas into a visually compelling user interface.
			Understanding the cascade, specificity, and various selectors felt like
			unlocking a toolkit filled with endless possibilities.</p>
			
			<p>Overall, This CSS 241 course has been a great experience,
			it gave me a good understanding of both HTML5 and CSS3, and how much I have yet
			to learn. I look forward to applying the knowledge I gained to future projects and continuing 
			to explore all the possibilities with web development.</p>
